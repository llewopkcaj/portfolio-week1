# Portfolio Week 1

My first HTML + CSS project, built during Week 1 of my developer roadmap.  
Deployed live with GitHub Pages.

üåê **Live site:** [https://llewopkcaj.github.io/portfolio-week1/](https://llewopkcaj.github.io/portfolio-week1/)

## About
This is a simple portfolio page to practice:
- Semantic HTML (header, section, footer)
- CSS basics (fonts, colors, box model)
- Flexbox centering and layout
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Next Steps
- Expand with projects as I build them
- Add JavaScript interactivity (Week 2)
- Continue polishing design and responsiveness
